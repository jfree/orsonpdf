Overview
--------
OrsonPDF is a PDF generation library for the Java(tm) platform that allows you to create content in PDF format using the standard Java2D drawing API (`Graphics2D`).  OrsonPDF is light-weight, fast, and has no dependencies other than the Java runtime (1.6 or later).  The home page for the project is:

http://www.object-refinery.com/orsonpdf/

Getting Started
---------------
The Javadoc page for the PDFDocument class gives an example of typical usage and, if you are already familiar with the Java2D APIs, then all you need to do is add `orsonpdf-1.9.jar` to your classpath and start coding.

Oracle provides tutorials for Java2D here:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/

There are some demonstration applications included in the [JFree Demos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-demos) project. 


Include
-------
OrsonPDF is published to the Central Repository. You can include it in your projects with the following dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.orsonpdf</groupId>
        <artifactId>orsonpdf</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
    </dependency>

For developers using the Java Module System, OrsonPDF defines the automatic module name `com.orsonpdf.orsonpdf`.  Alternatively, a new project (https://github.com/jfree/jfreepdf) has been created that supports Java modules directly but requires Java 11 or later.


Build
-----
You can build OrsonPDF from sources using Maven:

    mvn clean install


Dual Licensing
--------------
OrsonPDF is dual licensed.  You can use OrsonPDF under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) or later.  If you prefer not to be bound by the terms of the GPLv3, there is an option to buy a commercial license from Object Refinery Limited - see the OrsonPDF web page for details.

OrsonPDF integrates the Ascii85OutputStream class written by Ben Upsavs and distributed freely under the (BSD-style) terms listed in the Ascii85OutputStream-license.txt file.
